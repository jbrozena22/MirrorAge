    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> MemoryAge<br>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 25, 2026</p>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <strong>Summary</strong><br>
        MemoryAge is designed with privacy as a priority. Your personal family data (such as photos and names) never leaves your device. We use limited, anonymous analytics solely to improve app stability and performance. We do not use your data for advertising.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>MemoryAge ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how our iOS application handles your data. Our goal is to provide a helpful utility for parents while maintaining strict control over your personal content.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection & Storage</h2>
    <p>We believe that your family's personal data belongs to you.</p>

    <h3>A. Information Stored Locally (Strictly Private)</h3>
    <p>The following sensitive information is processed and stored <strong>only on your device</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Children's Names & Birth Dates:</strong> You enter this manually to calculate age comparisons. It is stored in local preferences and never transmitted to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo & Video Metadata:</strong> The app scans creation dates to find matches. This processing happens entirely on your device's processor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Information Collected for App Improvement</h3>
    <p>We collect limited, non-personal data to help us fix crashes and understand app usage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymized data about how you interact with the app (e.g., screens visited, buttons tapped).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Crash reports and performance metrics (e.g., launch time, hang rates).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We use unique device identifiers (like the IDFV) to distinguish between users in our analytics, but this is not linked to your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function, MemoryAge requires specific permissions on your iOS device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> We request access to your photo library to find videos of your older child that match the age of your younger child.
            <br><em>Note: We primarily use Read access to analyze timestamps. We do not upload your photos or videos to any server.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Tracking (Optional):</strong> We may ask for permission to collect analytics data. You can decline this request without affecting the app's core functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can revoke these permissions at any time in your iOS Settings app.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use trusted third-party services to ensure the app runs smoothly. These services may collect data linked to your device ID.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase (Analytics & Crashlytics):</strong> We use Firebase to collect crash reports and usage statistics. This helps us identify bugs (e.g., "The app crashed on the Home screen for 5% of users") and improve performance.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Data Collected:</em> Device Model, OS Version, Crash Logs, App Usage interactions.</li>
                <li><em>Privacy:</em> This data is aggregated and does not contain your photos, children's names, or personal contact info.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No Advertising:</strong> We do not display third-party ads or share your data with advertising networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is a tool for parents.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Information about children (names, birth dates, photos) remains strictly on the parent's device and is never collected by us.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> The usage data we collect via Firebase is non-identifiable and does not target children or collect personal information from them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect, store, or transmit personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> You can delete all personal data (names/dates) by uninstalling the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Analytics data is retained by our third-party provider (Google) for a limited period (typically 2-14 months) before being automatically deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. Continued use of the app implies acceptance of the policy.</p>
